# HotelPrice-Prediction_Airbnb

This project involved the analysis of multiple factors causing price variation of Airbnb hotels in Seattle, and designing of a price recommendation decision support system.   
The price of over 8921 listings was modeled based on the various crucial amenities, via multivariate regression and random forest. Investment recommendations for a new amenity were prescribed  based on predicted price increase for each neighborhood.
